### An Open-Source Web Client for App.Net

App.net is a social platform that enables people to accomplish a lot of goals, but it's most well-known for its microblogging community *(and slightly storied history)*. Nice.Social is a web application that was created to provide a tool that anybody could use to see a Filtered, mostly Spam-Free Global timeline in addition to their own in a single location. Nice.Social is an interactive tool, but can be used as a way to passively observe community interactions as well.

This code does not send any personal data to 3rd-party servers. All information is kept solely in the web browser or sent directly to the App.net servers. A NiceRank Index is downloaded from api.nice.social at launch and every hour afterwards to provide a list of accounts and their NiceRank scores. NiceRank is how the web application can effectively filter the Global Timeline to show primarily human-powered accounts and their interactions.

As with everything on GitHub, this project is a work in progress and you are welcome to contribute code, support tickets, and chocolate chip cookies to help make this tool better for everyone.

Want to see this code in action? Drop it in at directory on your computer or head over to [Nice.Social](https://nice.social).

Want to see some documentation? Visit the Wiki or, if you'd rather have it local, clone the documentation to your computer:

    `git clone https://github.com/matigo/nice_social.wiki.git`

###Usage

Using this code really couldn't be easier. Put the files somewhere. Access the `index.html` file. Everything is done through JavaScript and jQuery.

###Customisation

In order to use this website to interact with the App.Net API, you will need to enter an Application Client ID into file named `config.json`. Copy the `config.sample.json` file to `config.json` and customise it to your heart's content. You can [get a Client ID for free with your App.Net account](https://account.app.net/developer/apps/) regardless of whether you have a free, paid, or developer account. Don't worry about the exclamation mark message unless you do not see the "Create App" button.

Next you can enter the name and website of your application. If you plan on running these files from your computer, just enter anything into the website field.

![Create Application](https://nice.social/gitpics/2_create_app.jpg)

The third and final screen will give you the necessary `client_id` to interact with App.Net.

On this third screen you will also see a place for "Redirect URIs". You will need a good URI in this area before you can log in to App.net. If you are running the web application from a web server, enter the website address here. If you're running it on your computer, you will need to run Apache or some other web server software, and supply the URI. It might look something like `http://localhost:8080/` depending on how the software is configured.

If you're running the tool from a directory, you will only be able to watch the Filtered Global timeline scroll by. Although we can enter a `file:///` URI into the App.Net OAuth2 fields (example: `file:///Users/jason/Git/nice_social/index.html`), an external website cannot redirect a browser to an HTML file stored on your computer.

With that out of the way, if you haven't already, you can copy or rename the `config.sample.json` file to `config.json` and edit it to have your Client ID. Replace `[YOUR_API_TOKEN]` with the API Token (Client ID) granted by App.net. For example:

    `apiToken: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789',`

That's all there is to it. No special libraries, compiling, or other complex steps are required. Heck, this alone was complicated enough.
